3|S1|Section|Why This Matters|Time: 10 minutes|The fundamental shift in brand discovery|We're witnessing the biggest change in information discovery since Google's launch.||
4|S1|Content|AI Answers Are Replacing Search Results|The new front door|Google AI Overviews now appear in 15% of searches • ChatGPT hit 200M weekly active users in August 2024 • Perplexity, Claude, and others growing rapidly • Users increasingly skip traditional search results|Emphasis: People are getting answers without clicking. Your brand needs to BE the answer, not just rank in search results.||
5|S1|Content|LLMs Are Already Shaping Brand Perception|Reputation happens before the click|AI answers set expectations before prospects visit your site • Models synthesize information from multiple sources • These synthetic answers are often accepted as authoritative • First impression now happens in an AI response|Question for audience: When was the last time you used ChatGPT to research a company or product? This is your customers' new behavior.||
6|S1|Content|Invisibility Risk|If you're not present in AI, you don't exist|Brands absent from AI training data won't be recommended • Competitors who ARE present will capture mindshare • The window to influence model training is NOW • Later correction is harder than early presence|This is urgent. Models are being trained on today's web. What they learn now shapes answers for years.||
7|S1|Content|Section 1 Takeaways|Why this matters|AI discovery is replacing traditional search • Brand perception now forms in AI responses • Absence from AI = invisibility to prospects • The time to act is now|Transition: So if LLMs are reshaping perception, how should we think about them?||
8|S2|Section|LLMs as Stakeholders|Time: 15 minutes|A new kind of brand ambassador|Think of AI models as stakeholders who speak about your brand 24/7.||
9|S2|Content|LLMs: Your New Spokesperson|They speak about you whether you engage or not|LLMs answer thousands of queries about brands daily • They synthesize reputation from available information • Unlike traditional media, they're always-on and instant • They don't fact-check or call for comment|Key insight: You can't opt out. LLMs will talk about you. The question is whether you've given them the right information.||
10|S2|TwoColumn|Traditional Stakeholders vs AI Stakeholders|A fundamental difference|TRADITIONAL: Journalists - verify sources - deadline-driven - relationship-based - one article at a time <> AI MODELS: Instant responses - synthesize multiple sources - 24/7 availability - pattern-based - millions of conversations daily|This isn't a replacement for traditional PR. It's an additional stakeholder group that requires different strategies.||
11|S2|Content|Reputation Before the Click|AI sets expectations before human interaction|Prospect asks: "Who leads in shipping and logistics?" • Model answers based on training data • Perception formed before visiting any website • This answer influences whether they research you at all|Exercise: Try this now. Ask ChatGPT: "Who is the leader in shipping and logistics?" What does it say? Is Maersk mentioned? In what context?||
12|S2|Content|The Leadership Question|Positioning in AI responses|Models look for signals of leadership and authority • Market position, innovation, scale, trust • Industry awards, analyst reports, media coverage • The story must be consistent across sources|Critical point: You need to OWN the narrative across all touchpoints. Inconsistent messaging confuses models.||
13|S2|Content|Section 2 Takeaways|LLMs as stakeholders|Treat LLMs as a new stakeholder category • They form perception before human contact • They answer the leadership question constantly • You must proactively shape their knowledge|Transition: So where do LLMs actually get their information?||
14|S3|Section|Where LLMs Get Their Answers|Time: 15 minutes|Understanding model training sources|Not all sources are weighted equally.||
15|S3|Content|Trusted Sources Overview|What models prioritize|Tier 1 media: WSJ, Reuters, Bloomberg, industry trades • Wikipedia: Extremely high-weight for factual claims • Structured data: Schema markup, Knowledge Graph • YouTube: Growing importance for multimodal models • Owned channels: Your website, LinkedIn, investor relations|Foundation: Models inherit Google's trust framework plus their own authority signals.||
16|S3|Content|Google's Trust Framework|AI Overviews lean on established signals|E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust • Backlink authority still matters • Brand entity recognition in Knowledge Graph • Verified structured data on your properties|Google didn't abandon decades of ranking algorithms. AI Overviews build on them.||
17|S3|Content|ChatGPT and Claude|Different training, different priorities|Wikipedia has outsized influence on factual claims • Academic and long-form content weighted heavily • Recent news from authoritative outlets • Publicly accessible web content (respects robots.txt) • API partnerships for real-time data|Example: Ask ChatGPT a historical question vs. Google. Notice ChatGPT's Wikipedia-like responses.||
18|S3|TwoColumn|Coverage Strategy|Why ubiquity matters|SINGLE CHANNEL RISK: One great article - mentioned in one model - fragile if source changes - narrow perception <> UBIQUITY APPROACH: Multiple authoritative sources - cross-model presence - resilient to source changes - reinforced narrative|Don't put all eggs in one basket. You need presence across the spectrum of trusted sources.||
19|S3|Content|Section 3 Takeaways|Where models learn|Tier 1 media, Wikipedia, structured data are critical • Google and ChatGPT weigh sources differently • Broad authoritative coverage creates resilience • Consistency across sources reinforces positioning|Transition: Knowing where models learn, where should we focus effort?||
20|S4|Section|Where to Focus|Time: 15 minutes|Strategic priorities for AI presence|Don't abandon what works. Build on it.||
21|S4|Content|Don't Abandon PR|Traditional media is more important than ever|Tier 1 outlets remain primary training sources • Journalist-vetted information carries authority weight • Industry trade coverage establishes domain expertise • Media mentions create entity relationships in models|Double down on earned media. It feeds both traditional SEO AND AI training.||
22|S4|Content|Owned Content Strategy|Your properties matter more now|Website content with clear schema markup • Executive thought leadership on LinkedIn • YouTube for visual and voice search queries • Investor relations materials for financial credibility • Press releases through authoritative distribution|You control the narrative on owned channels. Make sure it's clear, consistent, and crawlable.||
23|S4|Content|LinkedIn and YouTube|Platform-specific advantages|LinkedIn: Professional context, executive voices, B2B authority signals • YouTube: Multimodal training data, voice search optimization, visual brand presence • Both: High domain authority, frequently crawled, rich metadata|These platforms punch above their weight for B2B brands. Executive presence here directly influences model training.||
24|S4|Content|The Ubiquity Strategy|Be everywhere that matters|Consistent messaging across all channels • Same positioning in media, owned content, social • Clear brand narrative that's easy to synthesize • Regular cadence maintains freshness in training data|Think of it as surround-sound for AI. The more consistent signals, the stronger the model's confidence in its response.||
25|S4|Content|Section 4 Takeaways|Where to focus effort|PR and earned media remain critical • Owned content needs optimization for AI • LinkedIn and YouTube are B2B power channels • Ubiquity and consistency create strong signals|Transition: Let's look at concrete examples of this in action.||
26|S5|Section|Examples|Time: 10 minutes|Real-world impact and tactics|Data from the field.||
27|S5|Content|AI Overview Traffic Impact|The 60% drop|Content-heavy sites seeing 60% traffic decline from AI Overviews • Users get answers without clicking through • Particularly severe for informational queries • How-to, definitions, comparisons hit hardest|This is why being IN the answer matters. If you're only optimized to get clicks, you lose when AI answers the question directly.||
28|S5|Content|Comparison Content Dominates|"X vs Y" queries are critical|"Maersk vs MSC" or "Maersk vs Hapag-Lloyd" • Models create comparison frameworks from available data • If you don't provide comparison content, competitors control it • Strategic opportunity: Define the comparison criteria|Action item: Create authoritative comparison content that positions you favorably. Define the playing field.||
29|S5|Content|Leadership Positioning Tactics|How to increase "leader" mentions|Claim industry awards and rankings prominently • Executive quotes in media about industry trends • Case studies demonstrating scale and innovation • Use clear positioning statements: "global leader in..." • Third-party validation: analyst reports, customer testimonials|Subtle but important: Models look for consensus. Multiple sources saying "leader" is more powerful than one.||
30|S5|TwoColumn|Before and After AI Optimization|Real positioning shift|BEFORE AI FOCUS: Generic corporate messaging - buried positioning statements - inconsistent narratives - thin owned content <> AFTER AI OPTIMIZATION: Clear leadership claims - consistent cross-channel messaging - rich, structured owned content - proactive comparison content|This isn't radical change. It's strategic clarity and consistency.||
31|S5|Content|Section 5 Takeaways|Examples in action|AI Overviews cutting traffic 60% for some sites • Comparison content controls competitive narrative • Leadership positioning requires consistent signals • Strategic content optimization increases AI presence|Transition: Now let's apply this to Maersk specifically.||
