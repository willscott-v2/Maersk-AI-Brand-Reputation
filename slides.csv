3|S1|Section|Why This Matters|Time: 10 minutes|The fundamental shift in brand discovery|We're witnessing the biggest change in information discovery since Google's launch.||
4|S1|Content|AI Answers Are Replacing Search Results|The new front door|Google AI Overviews now appear in 50%+ of searches (up from 13% in early 2025) • ChatGPT reached 800M weekly active users in 2025 (4x growth YoY) • Perplexity processing 780M monthly queries (up 240% from 2024) • SearchGPT, Gemini, and Claude expanding rapidly in enterprise|Emphasis: People are getting answers without clicking. Your brand needs to BE the answer, not just rank in search results.||
5|S1|Content|LLMs Are Already Shaping Brand Perception|Reputation happens before the click|AI answers set expectations before prospects visit your site • Models synthesize information from multiple sources • These synthetic answers are often accepted as authoritative • First impression now happens in an AI response|Question for audience: When was the last time you used ChatGPT to research a company or product? This is your customers' new behavior.||
6|S1|Content|Invisibility Risk|If you're not present in AI, you don't exist|Brands absent from AI training data won't be recommended • Competitors who ARE present will capture mindshare • The window to influence model training is NOW • Later correction is harder than early presence|This is urgent. Models are being trained on today's web. What they learn now shapes answers for years.||
7|S1|Content|Section 1 Takeaways|Why this matters|AI discovery is replacing traditional search • Brand perception now forms in AI responses • Absence from AI = invisibility to prospects • The time to act is now|Transition: So if LLMs are reshaping perception, how should we think about them?||
8|S2|Section|LLMs as Stakeholders|Time: 15 minutes|A new kind of brand ambassador|Think of AI models as stakeholders who speak about your brand 24/7.||
9|S2|Content|LLMs: Your New Spokesperson|They speak about you whether you engage or not|LLMs answer thousands of queries about brands daily • They synthesize reputation from available information • Unlike traditional media, they're always-on and instant • They don't fact-check or call for comment|Key insight: You can't opt out. LLMs will talk about you. The question is whether you've given them the right information.||
10|S2|TwoColumn|Traditional Stakeholders vs AI Stakeholders|A fundamental difference|TRADITIONAL: Journalists - verify sources - deadline-driven - relationship-based - one article at a time <> AI MODELS: Instant responses - synthesize multiple sources - 24/7 availability - pattern-based - millions of conversations daily|This isn't a replacement for traditional PR. It's an additional stakeholder group that requires different strategies.||
11|S2|Content|Reputation Before the Click|AI sets expectations before human interaction|Prospect asks: "Who leads in shipping and logistics?" • Model answers based on training data • Perception formed before visiting any website • This answer influences whether they research you at all|Exercise: Try this now. Ask ChatGPT: "Who is the leader in shipping and logistics?" What does it say? Is Maersk mentioned? In what context?||
12|S2|Content|The Leadership Question|Positioning in AI responses|Models look for signals of leadership and authority • Market position, innovation, scale, trust • Industry awards, analyst reports, media coverage • The story must be consistent across sources|Critical point: You need to OWN the narrative across all touchpoints. Inconsistent messaging confuses models.||
13|S2|Content|Section 2 Takeaways|LLMs as stakeholders|Treat LLMs as a new stakeholder category • They form perception before human contact • They answer the leadership question constantly • You must proactively shape their knowledge|Transition: So where do LLMs actually get their information?||
14|S3|Section|Where LLMs Get Their Answers|Time: 15 minutes|Understanding model training sources|Not all sources are weighted equally.||
15|S3|Content|Trusted Sources Overview|What models prioritize|Tier 1 media: WSJ, Reuters, Bloomberg, industry trades • Wikipedia: Extremely high-weight for factual claims • Structured data: Schema markup, Knowledge Graph • YouTube: Growing importance for multimodal models • Owned channels: Your website, LinkedIn, investor relations|Foundation: Models inherit Google's trust framework plus their own authority signals.||
16|S3|Content|Google's Trust Framework|AI Overviews lean on established signals|E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust • Backlink authority still matters • Brand entity recognition in Knowledge Graph • Verified structured data on your properties|Google didn't abandon decades of ranking algorithms. AI Overviews build on them.||
17|S3|Content|ChatGPT and Claude|Different training, different priorities|Wikipedia has outsized influence on factual claims • Academic and long-form content weighted heavily • Recent news from authoritative outlets • Publicly accessible web content (respects robots.txt) • API partnerships for real-time data|Example: Ask ChatGPT a historical question vs. Google. Notice ChatGPT's Wikipedia-like responses.||
18|S3|TwoColumn|Coverage Strategy|Why ubiquity matters|SINGLE CHANNEL RISK: One great article - mentioned in one model - fragile if source changes - narrow perception <> UBIQUITY APPROACH: Multiple authoritative sources - cross-model presence - resilient to source changes - reinforced narrative|Don't put all eggs in one basket. You need presence across the spectrum of trusted sources.||
19|S3|Content|Entity Mapping and Knowledge Graphs|How AI understands your brand|Named entities: Not keywords but recognized concepts with distinct meaning • Knowledge Graph: Google's entity database connecting people, places, companies • Entity connections: Who you're associated with matters (partners, competitors, industries) • Wikipedia presence: Critical for entity recognition across all models|AI doesn't just match keywords - it understands concepts. An entity is any concept with distinct meaning. Maersk isn't just a word, it's a recognized shipping company entity with attributes, relationships, and context.||
20|S3|Content|Citations and Direct Quotes|The currency of AI visibility|Direct quotes with attribution get highest weight in AI responses • Executive statements on record become model training data • Press releases and official communications are cited sources • Community validation: Multiple independent sources citing you increases authority • Earned media citations build credibility that owned content alone cannot|Citations are the currency of AI visibility. When multiple authoritative sources directly quote your executives or cite your company, models treat that as strong signal. This is why PR and earned media still matter - perhaps more than ever.||
21|S3|Content|Section 3 Takeaways|Where models learn|Tier 1 media, Wikipedia, structured data are critical • Google and ChatGPT weigh sources differently • Broad authoritative coverage creates resilience • Consistency across sources reinforces positioning|Transition: Knowing where models learn, where should we focus effort?||
22|S4|Section|Where to Focus|Time: 15 minutes|Strategic priorities for AI presence|Don't abandon what works. Build on it.||
23|S4|Content|Don't Abandon PR|Traditional media is more important than ever|Tier 1 outlets remain primary training sources • Journalist-vetted information carries authority weight • Industry trade coverage establishes domain expertise • Media mentions create entity relationships in models|Double down on earned media. It feeds both traditional SEO AND AI training.||
24|S4|Content|Owned Content Strategy|Your properties matter more now|Website content with clear schema markup • Executive thought leadership on LinkedIn • YouTube for visual and voice search queries • Investor relations materials for financial credibility • Press releases through authoritative distribution|You control the narrative on owned channels. Make sure it's clear, consistent, and crawlable.||
25|S4|Content|LinkedIn and YouTube|Platform-specific advantages|LinkedIn: Professional context, executive voices, B2B authority signals • YouTube: Multimodal training data, voice search optimization, visual brand presence • Both: High domain authority, frequently crawled, rich metadata|These platforms punch above their weight for B2B brands. Executive presence here directly influences model training.||
26|S4|Content|The Ubiquity Strategy|Be everywhere that matters|Consistent messaging across all channels • Same positioning in media, owned content, social • Clear brand narrative that's easy to synthesize • Regular cadence maintains freshness in training data|Think of it as surround-sound for AI. The more consistent signals, the stronger the model's confidence in its response.||
27|S4|Content|Section 4 Takeaways|Where to focus effort|PR and earned media remain critical • Owned content needs optimization for AI • LinkedIn and YouTube are B2B power channels • Ubiquity and consistency create strong signals|Transition: Let's look at concrete examples of this in action.||
28|S5|Section|Examples|Time: 10 minutes|Real-world impact and tactics|Data from the field.||
29|S5|Content|AI Overview Traffic Impact|The 60% drop|Content-heavy sites seeing 60% traffic decline from AI Overviews • Users get answers without clicking through • Particularly severe for informational queries • How-to, definitions, comparisons hit hardest|This is why being IN the answer matters. If you're only optimized to get clicks, you lose when AI answers the question directly.||
30|S5|Content|Maersk Keyword AI Overview Analysis|[SEMRUSH DATA PLACEHOLDER]|[Will to provide: SEMrush report showing which Maersk keywords trigger AI Overviews] • Industry-specific penetration rates • Competitive comparison opportunities • Strategic keyword prioritization|ACTION ITEM (Will): Run SEMrush analysis on Maersk's target keywords to identify which ones trigger AI Overviews. This will show where we're already present in AI and where there are gaps to fill.||
31|S5|Content|Comparison Content Dominates|"X vs Y" queries are critical|"Maersk vs MSC" or "Maersk vs Hapag-Lloyd" • Models create comparison frameworks from available data • If you don't provide comparison content, competitors control it • Strategic opportunity: Define the comparison criteria|Action item: Create authoritative comparison content that positions you favorably. Define the playing field.||
32|S5|Content|Leadership Positioning Tactics|How to increase "leader" mentions|Claim industry awards and rankings prominently • Executive quotes in media about industry trends • Case studies demonstrating scale and innovation • Use clear positioning statements: "global leader in..." • Third-party validation: analyst reports, customer testimonials|Subtle but important: Models look for consensus. Multiple sources saying "leader" is more powerful than one.||
33|S5|TwoColumn|Before and After AI Optimization|Real positioning shift|BEFORE AI FOCUS: Generic corporate messaging - buried positioning statements - inconsistent narratives - thin owned content <> AFTER AI OPTIMIZATION: Clear leadership claims - consistent cross-channel messaging - rich, structured owned content - proactive comparison content|This isn't radical change. It's strategic clarity and consistency.||
34|S5|Content|Section 5 Takeaways|Examples in action|AI Overviews cutting traffic 60% for some sites • Comparison content controls competitive narrative • Leadership positioning requires consistent signals • Strategic content optimization increases AI presence|Transition: Now let's apply this to Maersk specifically.||
